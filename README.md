# Stock Fundamentals Data Set Forecast

In this repository, I attempt to predict stock prices using the Stock Fundamentals data set 
(http://www.usfundamentals.com/). I have chosen to explore this data set because it is easily acessible while also
relatively unclean (e.g. has missing values), allowing me to exercise data science skills, and challenging to use 
for my current machine learning skill level.

This is my first end-to-end machine learning personal project.

I have opted to not use Jupyter notebooks due to personal preference, but it is a tool I would like to explore in future
personal projects.

Script order:
1. *exploratory_data_analysis.py* - we begin by exploring a simple part of this data set, the latest quarterly snapshot
(*latest-snapshot-quarterly.csv*) to get a feel for the data and how to process and analyse it. *quarterly_snapshot_feature
_importance.png* and *quarterly_snapshot_hist.png* are two plots generated by this script.
